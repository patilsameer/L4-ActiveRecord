Here some magic happens. ActiveRecord automatically provides a bunch of methods to our Todo class (thanks to the inheritance from ActiveRecord::Base) that'll allow us to interact with the database table. One of these methods is create! which allows us to insert a new row into the table.

Try this out in irb:

require './connect_db.rb'
require './todo.rb'
connect_db!
Todo.create!(todo_text: "Buy groceries", due_date: Date.today + 4, completed: false)
Todo.create!(todo_text: "Call Acme Corp.", due_date: Date.today + 2, completed: true)
Todo.create!(todo_text: "File taxes", due_date: Date.today, completed: false)

This will create three new todos in our todos table with the given contents. If we were to write this in SQL directly, the queries would have the form:

INSERT INTO todos (todo_text, due_date, completed) VALUES ("Buy groceries", "2020-01-20", false);
